This **Redux** version is an improved version of the original **Blaze Black 2**!

## New Features in Redux Version:

- Three game modes: Easy, Challenge, and Black City.
- You can catch every Legendary and Mythical Pokémon.

- Item locations have changed, and Pokémon moves are updated.
- Changes to Pokémon types, trainers, wild area, and trades!

## Features from Original Blaze Black 2:
- **Wild Pokémon** have been edited in all areas. Most areas now have at least 8 Pokémon species, and sometimes more! You can get most Pokémon before the 7th gym. Some legendaries are only available after the Elite Four.
- **Trainer teams** have been edited. Most trainers, especially Gym Leaders, rivals, and the Elite Four, are now harder. Gym Leaders’ teams depend on the mode you choose. In Normal Mode, they have 3 to 5 Pokémon, while in Challenge Mode, they have 6.
- **Pokémon edits**: Many Pokémon have changes to their moves, abilities, and stats. Dream World abilities are easier to get now.
- Some moves have changed. For example, **Pledge moves** have 100 power, and **Cut** is now a Grass-type move.
- **Evolution changes**: Some Pokémon that needed trades to evolve now evolve with items. For example, Magmar evolves using a **Magmarizer**. There are new items like **Covenant Ore**, **Woodland Ore**, and **Frozen Ore** to help with evolutions. Some Pokémon, like Scraggy and Larvesta, evolve earlier to be more useful.
- **Item changes**: Items like **Flamethrower**, **Thunderbolt**, and **Earthquake** TMs are found earlier in the game. Evolution items like the **Reaper Cloth** and **Protector** are now easier to find.
- Some **Poké Marts** have new items, like **Luxury Balls** and evolution items.
- **Text changes**: Some dialogues have been edited to explain item changes. Juniper’s speech at the beginning is also different, showing the hack is working.
- **One-time encounter Pokémon** like Cobalion and Virizion have higher levels now. There are more legendary Pokémon you can find during the game.
- Some **trades** have been improved with better IVs. You can now trade for a **Togepi**, **Gengar**, or **Exeggutor** before beating the Elite Four.
- New **events**: Gym Leader rematches, Hoenn Gym Leaders, starter Pokémon from Harlequins, and battles with **Hilbert** and **Hilda**! You also get keys for Easy and Challenge modes early in the game.
- **Hidden Grottos** now have more useful Pokémon and DW abilities.  
- Some **TMs** have been replaced. For example, **Sky Drop** and **Struggle Bug** are replaced with **Hurricane** and **Bug Buzz**.
